1.This lab felt like it went really well for me. I feel I am starting to think programing more now than before.

2.The most difficult for me was in the task6 when I had to modify the code from using index to pointers. 
There were some places in the for loops that I got to some error messages 
regarding the cout << syntax when using pointers. It said that << had no operand or something like that.
I googled around and the solution I found was that I was supposed to overload the cout function or something.
I don't think we have talked about overloading except on functions so I tried instead to do something else and
ended up getting the C++11 for(auto:)loop to work instead. I used that on everything except the load function
were I couldn't figure out how to syntax it. I used a while instead there. Other than that I feel like it went well.
(Unless I totally missunderstood pointers or something, but the code works.)


3. This lab was easier to understand the assignments than lab 2. So that was good. :)

4. I think the time it took for me to complete this was around 10 hours.
